After thinking of writing a clich√©d Hello World post, I was curious about why every first program is a variation of Hello World. 

The History of "Hello World!"
----------------------------

The first Hello World program was written in BCPL. BCPL was a precursor to B, which influenced C. Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, who wrote the C language, included the Hello World program in their famous book, `The C Programming Language`. Many programmers were introduced to C as their first programming language through this book. They used Hello World as the first program while learning or authoring books for other languages!

Why we keep using it
--------------------
For new programmers, it's a rite of passage. For people who are testing a new compiler or dev environment, it's the easiest way to check if everything is installed correctly.
