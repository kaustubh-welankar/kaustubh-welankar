Hi, I'm Kaustubh Welankar, a 2nd Year computer science student at [BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/). 

I mainly code in C++ and have some experience with Qt.

Computer Science courses that I'm currently doing are:
* Object Oriented Programming

* Logic in Computer Science
* Digital Design

If you find any discrepancy in my posts, please contact. I'll be glad to make corrections :)
